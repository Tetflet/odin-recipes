    <h2>Description:</h2>
    <p>A nice and simple holiday meal for the whole family to enjoy.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 (6 pound) fully-cooked, bone-in ham</li>
        <li>1 fresh pineapple</li>
        <li>2 (6 ounce) cans pineapple juice</li>
        <li>1 cup brown sugar</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Directions:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). 
            Place ham, cut-side down, into a roasting pan.</li>
        <li>Cut skin off pineapple with a sharp knife and slice off any brown 
            spots or skin left behind. Cut pineapple into 1/2-inch-thick rings 
            and use a round cutter to remove cores. Pin rings onto ham with toothpicks.</li>
        <li>Bake ham in the preheated oven for 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>While ham bakes, mix pineapple juice and brown sugar in a microwave-safe 
            bowl. Microwave on medium power until glaze is boiling and slightly 
            thickened. Work carefully because glaze will be sticky and very hot.</li>
        <li>Pour 1/2 of the glaze evenly over ham and pineapple rings. Bake ham 
            for 30 minutes more, then pour remaining glaze over ham.</li>
        <li>Continue baking ham until a meat thermometer inserted into the 
            thickest part of ham reads 140 degrees F (60 degrees C), 30 to 60 minutes more.</li>
    </ol>
